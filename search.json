(0.0.0.9003) Added lrtp() print method, tests. (0.0.0.9004) Added vignette, Get Started. (0.0.0.9005) Fixed issues vignettes. (0.0.0.9006) Moved “TODOs” issues. (0.0.0.9007) default, method print.lrtp() print Wald statistics (z statistics, Wald p-values, Wald confidence intervals). (0.0.0.9008) chi-squared difference LRT p-value also printed. (0.0.0.9009) Fixed bug inserting columns lrtp(). (0.0.0.9010) free_pars() can identify apparently free parameters actually fixed due equality constraint constant. (0.0.0.9011) Updated fix_to_zero() check whether requested parameter successfully fixed zero. (0.0.0.9012) Updated fix_to_zero() handle parameters involved internal equality constraint (e.g, constrained equal groups group.equal argument lavaan::lavaan()). (0.0.0.9013) Updated fix_to_zero() handle labelled parameters. (0.0.0.9014) Updated fix_to_zero() check VCOV modified model. failed get VCOV, modified model may identified. (0.0.0.9015) Updated lrt(), lrtp(), print.lrtp() handle error LR test. (0.0.0.9016) Updated theme pkgdown site. (0.0.0.9017) Revised several functions problems fitting modified model recorded, instead raising error. structure output lrt() fix_to_zero() also modified include indicators error. avoid unnecessarily storing many copies original fit object, change made output lrt() times break code previous versions semlrtp. (0.0.0.9018) no_variances lrtp() revised handle variances, error variances. (0.0.0.9019) Fixed bug labelled variance. (0.0.0.9020) Added internal function lhs_to_par_id() converting model syntax string parameter table row number.
